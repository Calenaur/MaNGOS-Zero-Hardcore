VANILLA WOW BRANCH
===
### A World of Warcraft server for Vanilla WoW  
----
*Mangos* is open source project, built in [C++][7], it's fast, runs on multiple
platforms, can store game data in [MySQL][40] and [PostgreSQL][42]. It also has
optional support for SOAP, and aims to be 100% compatible with [World of Warcraft][2]
in its vanilla versions, namely [patch 1.12.1][5] and [patch 1.12.2][6].

If you liked the first incarnation of [World of Warcraft][2] and still want to play
[vanilla WoW][4], this is the branch for you. We provide an authentication
server where you can manage your users, and a world server which serves game
content just like the original did back then.

On top of that each update is built by [Travis CI][16] as you can see by the
image next to the chapter's heading! We do love green builds, and working things.
To complement this, we push builds through [Coverity][17] to find and fix any
possible security issues.
